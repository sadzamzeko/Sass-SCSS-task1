            <p><span class="orange"> HTML </span> is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"><span class="green">» W3C</span></a>, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language. The definition of HTML is <span class="orange"> HyperText Markup Language </span>. HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text.</p>

            <p><span class="orange"> CSS </span> stands for <span class="orange">Cascading Style Sheets</span> with an emphasis placed on “Style.” While HTML is used to structure a web document (defining things like headlines and paragraphs, and allowing you to embed images, video, and other media), CSS comes through and specifies your document’s style—page layouts, colors, and fonts are all determined with CSS. Think of HTML as the foundation (every house has one), and CSS as the aesthetic choices (there’s a big difference between a Victorian mansion and a mid-century modern home).CSS brings style to your web pages by interacting with HTML elements. Elements are the individual HTML components of a web page.In CSS, the selector is written to the left of the first curly bracket. The information between curly brackets is called a declaration, and it contains properties and values.</p>
